The inky/purple-colored 2009 possesses plenty of creme de cassis, bouquet garni, blackberry, chocolate, vanilla and toast characteristics. It is full-bodied, but the tannins are formidable and the wine seems to be in one of those broodingly backward stages that require patience from potential buyers. There were 10,540 cases produced, so it was a modestly sized vintage, and the wine is slightly lower in alcohol than the 2008.","""","""Extravagantly rich, this seems to be perfumed by its tannins.

Chateau Haut-Brion  2009,$999.00,,"""What a blockbuster effort! Atypically powerful, one day, the 2009 Haut-Brion may be considered to be the 21st century version of the 1959. It is an extraordinarily complex, concentrated effort made from a blend of 46% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 14% Cabernet Franc with the highest alcohol ever achieved at this estate, 14.3%. Even richer than the perfect 1989, with similar technical numbers although slightly higher extract and alcohol, it offers up a sensational perfume of subtle burning embers, unsmoked cigar tobacco, charcoal, black raspberries, wet gravel, plums, figs and blueberries. There is so much going on in the aromatics that one almost hesitates to stop smelling it. However, when it hits the palate, it is hardly a letdown. This unctuously textured, full-bodied 2009 possesses low acidity along with stunning extract and remarkable clarity for a wine with a pH close to 4.0. The good news is that there are 10,500 cases of the 2009, one of the most compelling examples of Haut-Brion ever made. It requires a decade of cellaring and should last a half century or more. Readers who have loved the complexity of Haut-Brion should be prepared for a bigger, richer, more massive wine, but one that does not lose any of its prodigious aromatic attractions. ""","""Aromas of forest floor, currants and blueberries, with hints of fresh tobacco and sliced mushrooms. Turns to orange peel and blueberries. Full-bodied, with incredible structure. This is so powerful in tannins, yet so polished. This is the most structured Haut-Brion that I have ever tasted. This has 15% Cabernet Franc, which is more than normal and perhaps giving the wine a little more tannic structure. A monumental Haut-Brion made to age for centuries. I have never tasted a young Haut-Brion, with such spellbinding power and depth. A modern 1945 or 1961 HB? Better than the legendary 1989? Try in 2021.""","""This enormous young wine is among the most backward of the vintage at this early stage, with iron-clad grip holding the broad, deep core of blackberry, cassis and roasted fig notes in check for now.

This one is for the kids born in 2009. Best from 2020 through 2040.""","""Vivid deep ruby.  Knockout fruity nose offers blackcurrant, strawberry, rosemary, truffle and a stony note.  Then very closed in the middle, with cabernet sauvignon-dominated flavors of cassis, cigar box, cedar and minerals.

Pol Roger Brut,$57.99,"Pol Roger, one of a few luxury Champagne firms still family-owned, was established in Epernay in 1849.

The second or deeper cellar maintains a constant 9.5º C (50º F), one degree lower than the first level and most others in the region. This lower temperature slows the second fermentation, encouraging a finer mousse or bubbles.

Dalhuin told me that in whisky barrel-tasting vintages such as 1989 and 1990, Mouton was aged in heavily-toasted barrels, and they have backed off to a much lighter toast for the barrels’ interior. I think this has worked fabulously well with the cassis quality fruit they get from their Cabernet Sauvignon. The full-bodied, powerful 2006 possesses extraordinary purity and clarity. A large-scaled, massive Mouton Rothschild that ranks as one of the top four or five wines of the vintage, it may turn out to be the longest-lived wine of the vintage by a landslide. The label will undoubtedly be controversial as a relative of Sigmund Freud, Lucian Freud, has painted a rather comical Zebra staring aimlessly at what appears to be a palm tree in the middle of a stark courtyard. I suppose a psychiatrist could figure out the relationship between that artwork and wine, but I couldn’t see one.

Anticipated maturity: 2020-2060+.""","""At the time it was shown as a barrel sample in early 2007, this was the best wine of 2006. That accolade remains. It has all the power of the Cabernet Sauvignon in Pauillac, which was the greatest success of the vintage. That power comes from the dense tannins as well as the black plum and spice flavors and minerality. The texture becomes velvet, giving a final richness, but never losing its long aging potential. In a year that is good, but not at the top, Mouton has made a great wine.""","""Bright ruby-red. Vibrant aromas of cassis, blueberry, cedar and graphite. Wonderfully pure and silky in the mouth, with great subtle, slow-building intensity and superb energy and thrust. A real essence of cabernet sauvignon and Mouton terroir This one really rattled my brain-in the gentlest way. As silky as it is, it possesses bottomless depths. Finishes with big but noble tannins and outstanding length. I loved this wine the spring after the harvest, and it's even more impressive today. This should go on for decades, but today it's hard to imagine this wine going through an extended sullen stage.

Andrew Will Winery Two Blondes Vineyard 2010,$57.99,"This wine is true to the vintage and the vineyard it comes from. The focused and yet soft middle palate is at once indicative of the vintage and the vineyard's characteristics. The fruit is bright and yet giving.

We like it now, if opened for a few hours, with a great variety of food including seafood with almost anything but a cream sauce.

Its ruby, semi-opaque color is followed by a medium-bodied, elegant effort that has notions of red plums, underbrush, licorice and cedar on both the nose and palate.

Nita  2011,$23.99,"Akin to a bright red ruby in its color and rarity, Nita is a unique gem from the Spanish appellation of Priorat. From a region typically known for its concentrated barrel-aged reds, this wine is one of only a few jovenes, or non-barrel aged wines, produced within this celebrated appellation. Unaffected by the excessive toasted notes that barrel aging can produce, the 2011 Nita is perfect for those who want to taste the fruit and terroir of a wine in its purest form. Brain child of young female winemaker Meritxell Pallejà, this wine retains all of the characteristic minerality of Priorat, while better preserving the complex fruit flavors of old-vine Garnacha and Cariñena.

These two outstanding Brunate examples from 2007 offer great early appeal but I still find the 2008s to be a bit more urgent and structured.""","""Menthol, eucalyptus and cherry aromas and flavors highlight this elegant, high-toned red.

Very much adhering to the Signorello preference for wines of extract and substance, it is long on stuffing and depth, and its very ample serving of ripe, blackcurrant fruit is seasoned with plenty of rich oak.

It is a big, voluptuous wine with tons of inner perfume and expressive dark red raspberry jam, smoke, licorice and tar.

Usually blending Cabernet Franc and Syrah together would not be a high priority on most winemaker’s agenda, but Maltus marches to the beat of a different drummer and clearly has something special on his hands.

Neyers Syrah Sonoma Coast Old Lakeville Road 2012,$27.99,"No wine grape suffers more than Syrah from clumsy viticulture and improper cellar practices. In America, over-ripe harvesting, excess tannin extraction, and high alcohol winemaking have done this variety great harm. Legions of potential fans have turned away. Yet at Kermit Lynch, I have learned that wines from Syrah – especially those from northern Rhone producers like Clape, Gonon, Monier, and Faury -- are in great demand. What happened to Syrah in America? Some winemakers thought that if 13% alcohol was good, 15% alcohol was better. If 25% new oak was good, 100% new oak was better. Winemaker Tadeo Borchardt has been making our Old Lakeville Syrah with an eye on the practices of the Old World masters we admire.

Layers of fruit continue to develop, leading to a rich, creamy finish that is striking in its beauty. A relatively big, fruit-driven wine, the 2008 is all about balance. In this style, it is easily one of the very finest wines made in Montalcino. I have to say, it is also one of the most joyous, exuberant wines I tasted during my week in Montalcino.

Bodegas La Emperatriz Finca La Emperatriz Rioja Reserva 2007,$32.99,"Reserva 2007 is ruby red in color, very bright, with a light-red eye
(robe). It has a highly intense aroma and bouquet, with the bouquet of vanilla, cigar box, and caramel from the aging process is immediately noticeable. Upon further appraisal, the varietal aromas such as blackberries, plums, and orange peel come forward. When the wine opens up in the cup, the red and black fruit
aromas that are characteristic of Tempranillo appear. It is a very elegant wine, with intensity in the mouth, good acidity, and with a strong middle palate. The tannins are very polished and rounded. The wine's finish is fruity and lightly spiced. It is pleasant to drink and does not saturate the palate.","""The 2007 Finca La Emperatriz Reserva comes from 60-year-old bush vines. It has a melted, sensual nose of macerated red cherries, a hint of sloes and eau-de-vie. There is just the right amount of volatility to lend it lift without diminishing the freshness. The palate is rounded and sumptuous in the mouth with cranberry, wild strawberry and red currant mingling with Asian spices and tobacco. The finish is very composed, with impressive weight and length, but does not outstay its welcome. This is a very fine Reserva that should age well over the next decade. Drink now-2022. 

Bodegas La Emperatriz, named after its 19th century owner “Eugenia de Montijo” (the wife of Napoleon III), is located in Rioja Alta. It is owned by Victor and Eduardo Hernaiz, and the present winemaker is David Gonzalez. Theirs is a hugely impressive portfolio that singles out specific parcels and terroirs, though you should not ignore their excellent Crianza and Reserva. Factor in a wallet-friendly price and you have a winning formula.

The luscious tannins, the intense aromatic complexity and its opulence create a flamboyant yet harmonious ensemble, leading to a very long, complex and smooth finish. This early charming and collectible wine represents the passionate, uncompromised and on-going pursuit of quality.

It is simply the ‘ne plus ultra' of the Morlet wine production.","""Good bright, deep red.  Cassis, graphite, cedar, licorice, tobacco and flowers on the nose.

Despite its considerable richness and plushness, the 2007 never loses its classical sense of structure. If that combination sounds appealing, believe me, it is. This is a flat-out stunner from Mastroberardino. Best of all, it will drink beautifully pretty much right out of the gate.

Strict quality control continues at the winery through a state of the art optical berry selector, Vistalys, which chooses only the freshest and purest grapes for our wine. To extract structure and color, the grapes were macerated up to 4 weeks, during which the fermentation lasted 2 weeks in stainless steel tanks utilizing native yeast. To add complexity, yet maintain the natural expression of the fruit, 21% of the wine was aged in French Oak barrels after fermentation.

Chateau Monbousquet Blanc 2005,$85.00,"This wine made from Sauvignon Blanc and Gris demonstrates Saint-Emilion's potential for great white winemaking. The key is in understanding the terroir to achieve the mineral expression fundamental to a complex white wine. The wine's golden-yellow color is brilliant and limpid. Aromatic intensity is expressed through fresh citrus peel, lime, lemon, and passion fruit—a remarkable complexity that is in constant evolution as the wine continues to breathe. The wine's attack is fresh and full, with richness balanced by an acidity of fine structure and quality. The mid-palate is smooth, showing great volume. Although oak is present, it has become well-incorporated by reducing the excessive barrel aging of previous vintages. This change from the formerly massive style is most welcome. This is a lively wine showing fine mineral character and a good, long finish that is mouthwatering and flavorful—it is the type of wine which makes you want another glass. The 2005 vintage is well-known for its red wines, but the whites offer immense pleasure, too. The wine shines with a meal of Brittany shrimp, roast crayfish, lobster salad, or filet of bass with oysters. Another good choice would be roast poultry with winter mushrooms. And don't forget the goat cheese.","""More Burgundian than Bordeaux-like, Gerard Perse’s 2005 white Monbousquet exhibits rich, medium to full-bodied flavors of smoky oak, mango, white peaches, honeysuckle, and nectarine. While delicious, its aging potential is suspect, and I suggest consuming it over the next 4-5 years

Champagne Barons de Rothschild Rose,$119.99,"Barons de Rothschild Rosé shows assertive finesse in a blend of Champagne's greatest Chardonnays and its top Pinot Noir. The high

a delight to the senses. The first taste is fresh and precise, melting into the palate like silk, with slight raspberry undertones. It features
fine, subtle aromas, reminiscent of spring, alongside the fragrance of rose petal, wild strawberry, and a hint of citrus zest. The
fine thread of bubbles ends in a thin, enduring foam, and its light color offers the slight shimmer of salmon pink. This wine is long,
balanced and full of delicious body.

It already has nice depth but give it time to develop complexity. ""","""The 2010 Guado al Tasso comes across as incredibly stern and tannic, with little of the aromatic expressiveness and sheer juiciness of the best years. The warm, resonant Cabernet Franc bouquet and dark fruit are less evident than they are normally. In 2010 the rains were particularly challenging, which means the percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc way down, while Merlot is up.

There is a beautiful tension between the intense minerality of Mesnil and the warmth of the vintage.

Pol Roger Brut (375ML half-bottle),$37.99,"Pol Roger, one of a few luxury Champagne firms still family-owned, was established in Epernay in 1849. Pol Roger owns 200 acres of vineyards, which provide about 45% of their needs. Pol Roger's cellars extend over four miles of winding chalk passageways on two levels. The second or deeper cellar maintains a constant 9.5º C (50º F), one degree lower than the first level and most others in the region. This lower temperature slows the second fermentation, encouraging a finer mousse or bubbles. Pol Roger Champagne also spends two to three times the allowable minimum in the cellar before disgorgement, or about three years for the non-vintage and up to seven for the luxury cuvées. The long, slow maturation contributes greatly to the complex aromas, which distinguish these superb Champagnes.

It has plenty of body, a flavor dominated by walnuts, a creamy texture and a smooth, buttery finish.""","""Pol Roger's standard nonvintage cuvée is a rich wine, full in the mouth with a high proportion of Pinots and a creamy mousse.

Moreover, I bought an additional three cases of the newly released 2011 (reviewed here) for consumption in my home over the summer and early fall. This is a wine made by the family bodega of Jorge and his sister Victoria Ordonez. Producing 5,000 cases from the decomposed slate and quartz soils of Malaga, their harvest remarkably begins in July to capture the fresh, incredibly perfumed fruit of this varietal. It is then fermented totally in stainless steel, making it one of the most perfumed, naked expressions of dry white wine in the world. This is a killer example that people just love. Let me see if I can properly describe it. The exotic aromatics could fill a small room, with notes of flowers, honeyed white citrus, melons and hints of more exotic tropical fruit such as mango and tangerine. Jorge Ordonez and his sister Victoria, as well as their consulting winemaker, Gerhart Kracher (son of the late, great Alois Kracher) are trying to bring back the reputation of Malaga with wines such as this. The history of the wines of Malaga can be traced to 600 B.C. and the Greek era, and more recently, this area’s wines were celebrated by Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand in the 1500s, but then they largely fell out of favor until a number of innovative producers such as the Ordonez family, in alliance with the Krachers of Austria, began to resurrect the sweet wines as well as this incredibly perfumed, dry white, the only one to exist from this region.""","""Greenish straw.

Andrew Murray Camp Four RGB 2012,$18.99,"The RGB is named for the blend of Roussanne and Grenache Blanc, which is a typical white wine blend found  in and around the small villages in the south of France.  Typically Roussanne, which is more difficult to ripen and thus more rare, takes a backseat to the Grenache Blanc, which is a more neutral tasting grape.  We like to richen up this blend a bit and include more of the robust Roussanne.  The resulting blend is nearly a 50-50 balance between the two varieties.  The grapes were whole cluster pressed and then fermented and aged together in a small, temperature controlled stainless tank.  This early blending allowed the flavors to come together more completely.  After fermentation, the wine was transferred to neutral French Burgundy barrels to allow a bit more oxygen into the wine, which acted to soften and round out the final wine.  The aroma of this wine explodes with white flowers, green apple, a tropical/banana note, and a flinty/minerally note.  The aromas find their way onto the palate where you will sense a long, round, viscous mouthfeel made complex with a racy acidity.  The RGB is clean, fresh, and ready to drink.  It should, however, improve over the next couple of years.","""The 2012 Camp Four RGB, which was tasted out of tank, checks in as an even split of Roussanne and Grenache Blanc that’s all from the Camp Four Vineyard.

Dutton Goldfield Dutton Ranch Chardonnay 2012,$33.99,"The long, friendly 2012 growing season enhanced the pear, tropical and stone fruit tones in our Dutton Ranch Chardonnay, framing the focused citrus and minerality that are always at the core of the wine. The citrus aromas lean toward Meyer lemon and tangerine this year, supported by pear/guava fruit elements and ginger/cream wood characters, inviting you in for a sip. In the mouth, the lusciousness that expresses this season is balanced by solid acidity and an evolving fruit core that keeps you coming back. Lemon sourball, ripe pear and a touch of green apple fill out the fruit profile, while the steely minerality and sweet cream touches juxtapose to add a complexity that we love in this wine. Moderate alcohol and the signature juicy acidity of Green Valley facilitate the fresh, lingering citrus/ginger finish. This is a wine that evolves in the glass and will easily reward 5 years of cellar aging, but both will be a challenge with its immediate allure."

New oak plays a major role, but there is so much detail to the wine's flavor that it's just one more layer. A rich caress of dark fruit and earthy tannins make this delicious to drink now and over the next several years. It is, perhaps, too open for the long term."""

One-hundred percent whole clusters were used in its upbringing.""","""Deep red. Youthful cherry and dark berry skin aromas slowly pick up anise, cola and dried rose nuances. Firm, refreshingly bitter cherry and blackcurrant flavors are framed by dusty tannins and pick up a tangy mineral note with air. The tannins add grip to the very long, chewy finish. Give this at least an hour of decanting or a few more years in the cellar. There's a Nuits-Saint-Georges-like austerity and structure to this wine that's pretty intriguing."

With extraordinary richness, good underlying acidity, firm tannin, and a multilayered mouthfeel, this spectacularly concentrated 2001 is only hinting at its ultimate potential.

Moreover, analytically, the 2011 has a higher level of concentration as well as tannins than the 2009. A blend of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot and the rest Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, only 38% of the harvest made it into the grand vin. The wine offers an inky/purple color, barely noticeable sweet tannin, and a beautiful nose of creme de cassis, spring flowers and lead pencil shavings backed up by fresh acids and good overall structure.

Starting out with a nose of violets, wet rock and cassis, the entry takes on a richness that betrays its two hillside sources.

As with all hillside sites, the tannin is there it's just a matter of managing the quality of it that sets the wine apart. The structure here takes on a fine-grained sweetness and if it deviates from a fruit focus it moves more toward the varietally correct notes of creosote, charcoal and graphite with loamy, minerally tones creeping in.

Only 55% of the crop made it into Palmer, and given the lowest yields since 1961, the final blend of 55% Merlot and 45% Cabernet Sauvignon possesses huge tannins, but they are remarkably velvety and sweet. This opaque purple-colored, dense, concentrated, full-bodied wine will need time to totally form its personality.

Full-bodied, gorgeously pure and seamless, with solid underlying structure and a core of sweet fruit, it is a brilliant wine.

Following the hint of rusticity in the mouth, this is actually a rather refined wine, with a suave finish, broad tannins and very good breadth and verve.

I found this outstanding wine to be very LLC in style, not unlike a lighter version of the 2010.  The grapes were picked on 12 different days between October 4 and 18.

Isole e Olena Cepparello 2010,$71.99,"Cepparello is one of Italy's most iconic wines and a reflection of Paolo De Marchi's career.  1980 was the first vintage produced, but it started in the vineyard in the early 70's.

From there he started a 20 year journey of clonal selection and viniculture that ended with what today is considered the baseline for producing great Sangiovese in Chianti Classico.

A primal wine in need of significant cellaring, the 2010 is easily one of the highlights of the year. Bright, saline notes support the precise finish. Today, the 2010 is naturally quite backward and undeveloped, but it should be a gem in another 5-10 years. This is an especially dark, structured Cepparello built for the cellar. The 2010 brightens up with time in the glass, but it remains one of the darker, more brooding wines made in the estate's history.","""At times the 2010 Cepparello reminds me of the 2004, but with more depth.

A blend of equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot (47% of each) and the rest Cabernet Franc, it exhibits an opaque purple color as well as a magnificent bouquet of truffles, scorched earth, blackberry and blueberry liqueur, subtle smoke and spring flowers. The wine's remarkable concentration offers up an unctuous/viscous texture, a skyscraper-like mouthfeel, sweet, sumptuous, nearly over-the-top flavors and massive density. Perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime La Mission-Haut-Brion, the 2009 will take its place alongside the many great wines made here since the early 1920s. The good news is that there are nearly 6,000 cases of the 2009. It should last for 50-75+ years.

His limited cuvee of approximately 500 cases of the 2007 Chateauneuf du Pape Cuvee Centenaire (made from 80% Grenache aged in foudre, and the balance Syrah and Mourvedre aged in one- to three-year-old small barrels) comes primarily from a parcel of 120-year-old vines in the northern part of the appellation in the lieu-dit known as Farguerol. This cuvee has only been made in vintages such as 1989, 1990, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, and now 2007. Deep ruby/purple in color, the wine exhibits very up-front, precocious, sexy plum, black currant, and sweet cherry notes intermixed with some floral hints, licorice, and garrigue. It is dense, full-bodied, much more supple and silky-textured than the 2005 or 2001, but seemingly more concentrated than the 2000 version of this wine. It is a brilliant, full-throttle, seamless Chateauneuf du Pape capable of lasting for up to two decades, although few people will be able to resist its exuberant youthfulness.
""","""Vivid red color. Seductive, highly expressive aromas of raspberry, anise, Asian spices, smoky minerals and potpourri. Juicy, sweet and palate-staining, with vibrant red and dark berry flavors and superb clarity and back-end florality. The extremely long finish leaves sweet floral pastille and raspberry notes behind. This is one of the most seductive wines of the vintage and is already showing a lot of complexity."""
Chateau Gracia (Futures Pre-sale) 2011,$109.00,,"""I tasted this cuvee three times, and on each occasion it was totally exhilarating. Notes of white chocolate, creme de cassis, raspberry liqueur, truffles and lead pencil shavings emerge from this stunningly proportioned 2011.

Serve with risottos, egg pastas, red meat, white meat and cheeses.","""Dark red cherries, tobacco, menthol, licorice and mint waft from the glass in the 2009 Barbaresco Riserva Rio Sordo. This is an unusually dark, powerful Rio Sordo (within the context of the vintage) with fewer of the open, floral qualities that are the hallmark of this site. Today, the Rio Sordo is quite powerful and intense. It will be interesting to see if the finesse of this site develops with time."
The Calling Our Tribute 2010,$59.99,"This complex and structured wine is a blend of four classic Bordeaux varietals. The intense edge of Cabernet Sauvignon combines with Malbec's blackberry flavors, Merlot's roundness and finesse, and Petit Verdot's firm structure for a wine with layer upon layer of nuanced flavors and depth.

Taittinger Corneille - Collection Series 1990,$299.00,"The Taittinger Collection Series was conceived in the late 1970s by Claude Taittinger. Long a patron of the arts, with a passionate interest in the modern schools of painting and sculpture, he perceived a natural alliance between the creation of the artist and the art of the great winemaker. Thus, in 1983, Champagne Taittinger introduced the first of its revolutionary Collection Series, uniting art and Champagne in the design of a special bottle with a laser-sealed sheath that visually expresses the artist's concept of the magic of Champagne. Featuring the work of artists such as the French surrealist André Masson, American pop artist Robert Rauschenberg, and more recently the renowned Senegalese painter Amadou Sow, these exquisite bottles are commissioned well into the 21st century, and will perpetuate Champagne Taittinger's affiliation with the greatest artists of our time."
Wattle Creek Yorkville Highlands Sauvignon Blanc 2012,$15.99,"Sauvignon Blanc is an intensely aromatic varietal that can span a wide range of aroma profiles. The 2012 Sauvignon Blanc does not disappoint; it bursts out of the glass with powerful aromas of tropical fruit, ruby red grape fruit, and citrus rind, while notes of spear mint, anise and subtle dried herbs fill the background. The flavors are crisp and focused while the mouth feel is remarkably delicate and smooth."
Zaca Mesa Viognier 2012,$14.99,"The 2012 Zaca Mesa Viognier has aromas of honeysuckle and white peach.

Lewis Cellars Mason's Cabernet Sauvignon 2011,$64.99,"Now 10 years old Mason has joined the ranks of his double-digit brothers. It's not always easy being the youngest kid but this 2011 Mason's Cabernet has plenty of two-fisted punch. Lots of sweet and savory oak spices enter the ring first with a burst of ripe cherry-berry fruit that is laced with chocolate and a little licorice. Like Mason himself, the wine has a compact build with enough muscle and youthful tannin to ensure it keeps up with his brothers' bottlings.","""There is little question but that the 2011 vintage is one in which careful selection will go a long way, but, as in every year, there will still be good Cabernets to be had, and this one from Lewis proves that point. It musters far more richness and sheer fruity muscle than the admittedly less-pricey 2011s that are debuted in this issue, and the winery's predilection for high ripeness and substance cannot go unnoticed. It is big, very big, but with its size comes a clear theme of currants, and it is dressed up with plenty of very sweet oak. It is unconcerned with finesse now, and it may never be, but it will never be faulted for being timid or at all underfilled. """
Northstar Columbia Valley Merlot 2010,$39.99,"The 2010 vintage has rich concentrated aromas of black cherry, raspberry and cream that lead into flavors of clove, cinnamon and maple.

great focus, purity of fruit, and freshness. I think that's my 
favorite part. The freshness we captured. In no small part this 
vibrancy comes from the fact that most of the Grenache was

The 2011 is a big, sexy, smoky, classic La Mission displaying lots of road tar, graphite, barbecue, meats, mulberry, black currant and blueberry notes. It is full-bodied with sweet tannin as well as an expansive, fleshy style. The harvest was late in 2011 despite the fact that this micro-climate is one of the warmest and most precocious in all of Bordeaux since it is essentially in the city of Bordeaux. This brilliant wine, one of the vintage-s superstars, should drink reasonably well in 3-4 years and keep for 25 or more.","93-95 Points""","""An impressive wood- and tannin-laden wine, with intense, solid fruit.

Tenuta dell'Ornellaia  2011,$189.00,"The sun-filled, early-maturing 2011 vintage perfectly expresses the qualities of Ornellaia. The wine appears an intense, youthful fruit that is fully ripe yet at the same time crisp and lively, backgrounded by delicate nuances of balsam and toastiness.

The 2012 is certainly outstanding and, in fact, many readers may prefer it to the blockbuster, out-of-this-world, over-sized 2010, 2009 and 2008. Medium-bodied, pure and expressive, this classic Pauillac should only require 5-6 years of cellaring. It should drink well for two decades thereafter.","91-94 Points"""

Crown Cap Information:","
Despite their widespread use in champagne facilities and sparkling wineries around the world, crown caps
continue to be the winemaker's best-kept secret of the cellar. The primary use for crown caps in modern-
day winemaking is for secondary fermentation and aging on the yeasts. Every modern champagne
house and sparkling winery in the world uses crown caps during production (including the makers of
G.H. Mumm, Perrier Jouet, Roederer, Taittinger, Dom Perignon, Moet & Chandon, and Veuve Clicquot
to name a few.) It is not until the final product is prepared for market and disgorged, that a cork is
added to each bottle. Many notable wine critics predict however, that non-cork closures for still wines as
well as sparkling wines will soon outnumber bottles finished with cork in the marketplace due to their
superior ability to guarantee product quality."

Eighty percent of the grapes are grown on slate in the Corullon vineyards, with different altitudes and orientations, and the remaining 20% come from clay soils from the valley. It all adds to the complexity of the wine. The wine is very aromatic and flowery (violets), almost heady, with clear notes of blueberries and licorice. The oak is perfectly integrated, almost imperceptible, save for a touch of spices and a lactic hint denoting a very young wine. It has a medium body, with a thick silky texture, is very tasty, with some acidic strawberry flavors. This is one of my go-to wines at restaurant lists, as it offers very good value for money and is widely available in Spain (and elsewhere, I hope!), as 320,000 bottles were produced. This could very well be the best Petalos produced to date. Drink now through 2019. ""","""Deep ruby.  Smoky cherry and dark berry aromas are complemented by suave floral and dark chocolate nuances.

Chateau Pavie (3 Liter) 2005,"$1,739.00","This is the eighth vintage of Pavie produced under the ownership of Mme. and Mr. Perse, and it was a classic year which demonstrated that the chateau has a truly exceptional terroir.

Black currants, blueberries and assorted black fruit are present, together with flattering chocolate and spicy notes derived from careful aging in barrel. The first impression on the palate is faultless, and the quality of the vintage becomes evident as its taste evolves. The wine shows a full body, both tight and supple at once. Everything comes together to create an exemplary balance. The tannins are fine-grained, with a structure which ensures a long and brilliant future.

Best after 2015.""","""Now that the 2005 Pavie is in the bottle, I would place it, qualitatively, a notch below the prodigious 2000, and a few notches above the blockbuster 2003. There are 7,000 cases of this 70% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Franc, and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon blend. Disregarding the blatant jealousy of his success as well as his outsider status, proprietor Gerard Perse has pushed the envelope of quality, fashioning first-growth quality wines from one of Bordeaux's finest terroirs. In St. Emilion, only Ausone can be considered to have greater potential in terms of micro-climate and terroir. Pavie's 2005 exhibits a thick-looking purple color to the rim as well as an exquisite perfume of blueberry and blackberry liqueur, unsmoked cigar tobacco, crushed rocks, damp earth, and hints of truffles and incense. The vineyard's limestone soils have provided massive concentration, a laser-like precision, fresh, zesty acidity, and massive tannin. Despite the wine's enormous concentration and intensity, there is a lightness to its style. As Perse has made clear, he is trying to produce modern day versions of such great vintages as 1921, 1929, 1945, and 1947, wines that lasted 50 or more years. I do not understand why Perse receives so much criticism. In the blind tastings of each new vintage conducted by the Grand Jury European, Pavie usually wins against 100 or so other great Bordeaux. As they say, the truth is irrefutable - this is one of the world's most outstanding wines, and the 2005 Pavie should take its place among the greatest achievements of Bordeaux in the last 50 years. Anticipated maturity: 2020-2060.","""","""Saturated, deep ruby-red. Knockout nose combines blackberry, minerals, crushed rock, truffle, vanillin oak and flowers; showing none of the porty quality of the sample I tried last year.

In contrast, some of the young cabernet sauvignon vines didn't make it, which explains the lowest proportion of cabernet sauvignon (along with 2011) in the Calon-Segur blend in some years (2008 had 75%).  Millet thinks that the 2012 Calon is livelier than the 2011 (which had a similar pH but lower total acidity); he believes the '11 will be ready to drink sooner than 2012.

When I asked Bruno Borie how this could be, given the very high percentage of cabernet sauvignon in the blend, he mentioned the intensive work required to achieve this result:  he added two sorting tables directly in the vineyards and installed an optical sorting system in the cellar.

There is a mineral texture that’s layered with a juicy fruit character on the finish.","93-95 Points""","""Only 40% of the crop made it into the grand vin, which achieved 12.95% natural alcohol. The final blend for the 2011 Pichon Lalande was 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, 8% Merlot and 2% Petit Verdot. Under the administration of the new owners, the Merlot component has been dramatically reduced in favor of more Cabernet Sauvignon in the final blend. A strong effort, the 2011 boasts a dense ruby/purple color and abundant aromas of black currants intermixed with unsmoked cigar tobacco, serious body, more concentration than most of the classified growths, and a bigger, more structured style that may suggest a subtle change in the winemaking philosophy at this estate. This impressive wine is one of the vintage’s most interesting efforts. It should drink well for 15-20 years.","92-94 Points""","""This is really fantastic for the vintage with a wonderful balance and finesse, yet a firm impressive tannin structure.

Highly perfumed, knockout nose of strawberry, white pepper and flowers.  Bright and fresh in the mouth yet delineated and firmly structured, with a seamless quality to its red berry, floral and mineral flavors.  This oozes class and grace, finishing long and suave, with very smooth tannins.  Though this 2011 is less structured and powerful than the 2010 version, when Cheval Blanc gets the cabernet franc as it did in 2011, it's simply one of the world's greatest wines.  But chief viticulturalist and winemaker Kees Van Leeuwen told me that 2011 wasn't a walk in the park:  among the estate's many parcels, some had grilled berries and there was huge disparity in the ripening curve between parcels (some were extremely early and others late), leading to a harvest that lasted 23 days, the longest here in memory (normally it lasts 14 to 18 days).","92-94 Points""","""A really beautiful wine with super silky tannins with chocolate, spice, berries and spices.

A 30-year future is conservative.""","""The 2008 Entity Shiraz has a deep garnet-purple color and intense notes of kirsch, creme de cassis, menthol, chocolate, anise, spices and tree bark. Rich, concentrated and full-bodied yet not overly alcoholic (14.5% declared alcohol), this is a seamlessly balanced Shiraz unfolding layers of pure dark berry and spice flavors in the long finish. Though approachable now, it should open further in a year or two and drink well to 2020+. ""","""Opaque purple. Blackberry, violet, licorice, bitter chocolate and Indian spices on the nose. Dense and sweet but with racy, integrated acidity energizing the dark fruit, floral pastille and bitter chocolate flavors. Finishes with sweet tannins and noteworthy freshness and length.

The most masculine of this year's set of pinots from Rochioli and the one most in need of patience.""","""The 2011 Pinot Noir Sweetwater is quite closed today. There is good density and length in the fruit, but the elements haven’t fully come together just yet, probably because of the recent bottling, one month before this tasting. Sweet floral notes meld into hints of tobacco and new leather, but the fruit remains a bit muted today. It will be interesting to see where the Sweetwater goes in the next 6-12 months.",""""
Castello D'Albola Chianti Classico 2010,$19.99,"Light ruby-red color with slight orange hue on the rim. Cherry and other red berries with notes of sage, spice cake and subtle earth.

Chateau Sainte Marguerite Grande Reserve Rose 2012,$26.99,"A soft and rather pale colored rosé with raspberry and copper colored undertones. The gradation is a more silvery colored shade. The wine is bright, crystal clear and unclouded. Visually, it presents a good concentration of matter. The first impression is rather reserved if not discrete. However, the beautiful elegance of this wine is still evident. With only a little time to breathe, the wine quickly opens up with hints of red fruits, such as redcurrants, raspberries and strawberries, and hints of freesia and rose which bring a delicate side to the whole. Finally, we find aromas of garrigue, liquorice and myrtle which bring character and freshness to the wine. Palate - From the attack on the palate, we instantly find the elegant and delicate qualities from its aroma. Additionally, we find fruity flavors, in particular flavors of redcurrants, which give the wine its tangy side. The flavors linger for an average amount of time on the palate and are carried by the freshness of its acidity and the flavours of English sweets which we find on the finish. A pleasantly strong wine.

Quady Essensia Orange Muscat (375ML half-bottle) 2012,$14.99,"Made from 100% Orange Muscat, Essensia has an aroma reminiscent of Orange Blossom and Apricot. The wine is lightly fortified to about 15% alcohol and aged for 3 months in French Oak.

Mayacamas Chardonnay 2011,$39.99,"Chardonnay has been an important part of the Mayacamas story since the 1950s. The style, perfected by Bob Travers, gives wines that are lean, crisp and refined in their youth, and that develop flavors, layers and textures over the course of years, even decades. The 2011 Chardonnay is no exception. The wine is regal yet restrained, offering hints of pear skin, fig, and first fall rain.

The aromas and flavors are those of a warm vintage, yet there is considerable structure underpinning the fruit. Although likely to be a relatively fast-maturing wine, the 2009 should probably be cellared for another year or two to allow the tannins to soften. This is quite impressive for an entry-level Barbaresco. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2021. 

This is a terrific set of new releases from Prunotto. In particular, this year I was impressed with the quality and consistency of the entry-level offerings.

Louis Roederer Brut Vintage 2007,$75.99,"A warm gold robe with light copper highlights. The slow, regular flow of bubbles is perfectly integratedinto the structure of the wine. The bouquet is rich and heady, with a complex succession of juicy fruits
(Williams pears), red fruit (light raspberry liqueur) and nuts (hazelnut). There are a few hints of lightly roasted cocoa alongside warm notes of pastries and vanilla. The bite is an explosion of flavors and silky
substance. The juicy, fleshy fruits reinforce the soft smooth caress of the Pinot Noir - all with anoverwhelming freshness that is wholly part of the wine's texture, establishing great harmony. The subtle, controlled woodiness adds a sweet sensation, reinforcing the lightly roasted and vanilla flavors - without dominating the Pinot Noir fruit, which remains the focal point of this blend.

As it was, the Hugel family had already been trying to find a suitable way to distinguish Hugel Pinot Blanc from other Pinots, while making it recognizably French. It is the most approachable wine of Alsace and also the most consistent year in year out. Not far in style from an unoaked Chardonnay such as a Macon or Chablis."
Maquis Carmenere 2011,$16.99,"This Carmenere presents a complex, profound nose with spicy flourishes of cinnamon, clove, cocoa and red fruits. It is a vibrant, fresh wine with a long finish and tannins that come together to produce a smooth, beautiful, harmonious flavor."

Hints of apple pip lend subtle additional piquancy on a long and at once soothing as well as stimulating finish, with suggestions of oyster liquor becoming prominent as the bottle stands open for a few minutes, and serving to milk the salivary glands for all that they are worth.

Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion  2010,"$1,099.00",,"""This is crazy. The nose is so unique with the iodine, stones and currant aromas with wet earth and mushroom. Aromas like this don't usually come out until 10 years or so in the bottle. Classic nose for this estate. Full-bodied, with an amazing palate of firm yet polished tannins and a solid palate. So dense and gorgeous. It is really stunning. Try in 2020.""","""A strong candidate for a perfect score in about 15 years, the 2010 La Mission Haut-Brion could well turn out to be a modern-day version of their 1955. Sadly (or maybe fortunately) for me, I’m not old enough to have tasted the 1955 in 1958 from bottle, but this wine could also be an update on the more modern 2000 which, of course, I know well and actually own. This full-bodied, colossal giant of a wine is one of the goliaths of the vintage. It may well have the highest level of natural alcohol for any wine from the Left Bank of Bordeaux (15.1%) and has the definite potential to be a 50- to 75-year wine. Dense purple, it offers up notes of lead pencil shavings, charcoal embers, blueberry and blackberry liqueur along with massive concentration, a multi-dimensional mouthfeel and a monumental finish that goes well past a minute, which I think might be a record for a young Bordeaux. Keep in mind that the 2009, which I gave three digits, came in at 14.7%, but the pH of the 2010 is lower, giving the wine a freshness and precision that is remarkable. The final blend was 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, and – unlike the Chapelle de la Mission, which has 26% Cabernet Franc – there's only 1% Cabernet Franc in the 2010 La Mission Haut-Brion. This is a wine for those of you with youth on your side as well as patience. It will need a good decade of cellaring. An amazing wine. Anticipated maturity: 2024-2075+.","""","""Deep, saturated ruby-red.  Sweet, brooding aromas of cassis, coffee, minerals  and licorice.  Superconcentrated, voluptuous and seamless, with outstanding density of fruit and noteworthy precision to the compellingly sweet dark berry and mineral flavors.

This is one of my three or four top wines of the vintage.  (ID) 98(+?) points ""","""Intense and engaging. Despite showing lots of heft and tarry grip, the singed apple wood and alder notes are well-defined in this red, accentuating a core of roasted fig, blackberry coulis and macerated red and black currant fruit.

Incredibly sweet aromas of apricot, acacia honey and marzipan. Supersweet, round and fat, but with enough ripe acidity to leaven the wine's huge impression of volume. A powerfully fruit-driven Sauternes with superb depth, but it's almost too rich today. Finishes with palate-staining sweetness and length and surprisingly fresh acidity . I'd give this 15 years in the cellar. This is carrying a high 165 grams per liter of residual sugar, and the percentage of new oak was raised from a normal 35% to 65% for this vintage, and yet the wine does not come across as woody."""

It's balanced at the sweet end of the spectrum. """
Bravium Thomson Vineyard Pinot Noir 2010,$39.00,"This wine will age gracefully and will gain complexity in the bottle.  Dark ruby color with very floral aromas reminiscent of a Volnay, with background black tea notes.  The expressive nose gives way to black cherry and pomegranate flavors on the palate, where the fruit is balanced by just the right amount of food-friendly acidity.  This Pinot Noir is notable for its ultra-velvety mouthfeel.  An elegant and lingering finish is highlighted by spice notes.

Croix de Labrie  2010,$99.00,,"""Always one of the sexiest wines from Bordeaux, and probably best drunk in its first decade of life, this hedonistic fruit-bomb offers up oodles of jammy black cherry and black currant fruit interwoven with some floral notes, subtle oak, lead pencil shavings and a bit of toast. Voluptuous, full-bodied and silky smooth, with no aggressiveness, the tannins seem to melt on the palate, while the finish is long, supple and extravagant. Drink it over the next decade.""","""Wonderful complex nose with roasted hazelnuts, cocoa powder, coffee and strawberries. Great intensity and body on the palate with vibrant focused fruit. Layered texture and ripe and chewy tannins. Wonderful wine from a excellent terroir. Needs time to soften. """
Conti Costanti Brunello di Montalcino Riserva 2007,$115.00,"Only made in the finest years. 100% Sangiovese from vineyards at 1,315-1,480 feet. Once bottled, the wine rested at least 24 months before it was released. This wine is complex and austere, and will undoubtedly benefit from further bottle age, peaking in 5-10 years' time. Top vintages will also have top longevity.
","""There's finesse and beauty to this wine with plum and berry character, shaved chocolate and hints of almonds. Full and super fine. Gorgeous.
""","""The 2007 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva wraps around the palate with gorgeous depth. Plums, smoke, licorice, tobacco and mocha all develop in the glass. The 2007 gives the impression of being shaped a little more by the oak because of its voluptuous texture. A huge, explosive finish rounds things out nicely. This is an especially bombastic, rich wine for Costanti, but it is also quite fine and loaded with personality. There is plenty of pedigree in the glass. Still, more often than not, I find myself gravitating towards the straight Brunello bottling here. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2027.","""This is a meaty and masculine wine that is ready to drink now or within the next two to three years. It shows tight yet savory aromas of cured meat and spice followed by dried berry and cassis.

Complex aromas and flavors of minerals, red cherry, blackberry, mocha and leather, with a suggestion of almost liqueur-like ripeness leavened by a distinctly sappy quality. Broad and sweet but with excellent underlying structure, this wine finishes with broad, sweet tannins and repeating red cherry and sweet pipe tobacco flavors. An outstanding wine that is typically ripe and hot for the year, but it also has an element of grace that most other 2007 Brunellos do not possess.""","""A breath of fresh cherry, raspberry, floral and spice flavors, this red is elegant, vibrant and harmonious.

Wonderfully crisp in the mouth and very smooth. A wine that shows a freshness, roundness and fruitiness with a good length and hints of citrus and violet.
","""A similar blend (slightly more Grenache Blanc), the 2011 Chateauneuf du Pape Blanc shows a touch more citrus and green herbs, with additional minerality that is most likely due more to the additional year in bottle than anything else. Slightly leaner and straighter than the 2012, it too is a beautiful wine that stays beautifully focused, with impressive acidity and an overall classy feel. Drink it over the coming year or two.""","""This rolls over the tongue with the smoothness of a",", leaving a warm, sunny impression behind.

Morlet Billet Doux (375ML half-bottle) 2009,$99.99,"Deep crystal clear gold. Intense and complex bouquet of dry apricot, pêche de vigne and Reine Claude yellow plum intermixed with notes of quince, honey, Muscat and a hint of sweet vanilla. Full bodied, the palate is reminiscent of the nose, with a creamy sweet texture and a great intensity. The large amount of sugar and glycerin creates a highlighted viscosity.

Domaine de la Vougeraie Vougeot Premier Cru Le Clos Blanc de Vougeot 2009,$114.99,"Winemaker Pierre Vincent (formerly of Maison Jaffelin) declared that 2009 was a ""quasi-perfect vintage and the only reason I say 'quasi-perfect' is because we had some early season hail in Bonnes Mares, Chambolle and Charmes-Chambertin. The growing season was like 2005 that gave us very ripe tannins and round and supple acidities. The flowering was perfect, which made for a large crop with uniform ripeness levels. And because the growing season didn't have much rot pressure, the fruit was super clean and our sorting losses were less than 5%. We began picking on the 8th of September and started with the whites before moving on to the reds. The fruit averaged 13% in terms of potential alcohol and there wasn't even one wine that I decided to chaptalize, which is extremely rare. The vinification was easy even though I did a relatively long cuvaison of 25 to 28 days at a maximum temperature of 30° C. As I did in 2008, I used varying percentages of whole clusters, which I think added elegance. The malos were irregular with some beginning early and finishing late and some started late but finished quickly. The post-malo pHs were in the 3.65 range, which is perfectly acceptable to us. Overall, we are extremely happy with the potential quality of our '09s and believe that our clients are going to love them."" As I have observed previously, Vincent is making real progress and these '09s are easily the best wines I have yet seen from him, which is a real compliment as the '08s were excellent. Moreover, several of the villages level wines offer truly outstanding quality and should be on your radar screens for obtaining great value.","""Tasted out of the barrel at the Domaine. This has a very fine bouquet with well-defined notes of citrus lemon, hazelnut, a touch of orange zest and great mineralite. The palate is well balanced, the mineralite coming though again, touches of spice and walnut furnishing the entry, fanning out nicely across complex, Meursalt-like finish. Lovely.""","""One panelist compared the harmonic power of this wine to a night at the opera in the first row. The wine's energy has that sophistication and refinement, buzzing with limestone and mushroom earthiness, more focused on bass notes of umami and high-toned florals than any sweetness of fruit. Cellar this and you should be amply rewarded in ten years time.""","""A fresh and notably more elegant nose features mostly earth and soft floral notes where the earthiness also characterizes the concentrated, textured and utterly delicious middle weight flavors that possess good if not sensational depth on the dry, clean and linear finish. I like the sense of poise here.""","""A hint of toast introduces this lemon- and apple-infused white. Fresh and racy, with a vibrant structure and lingering lemon and apple aftertaste.

The vineyards are farmed biodynamically and much of the estate is planted on rootstock to prepare for the day when phylloxera works its way through Walla Walla. The wines are all fermented with indigenous yeasts and bottled unfined and unfiltered.","""The red wines start with the 2005 Grenache God Only Knows – Armada Vineyard, the first release of this wine. It was produced from yields of 1 ton per acre with 75% of the crop dropped on the ground. Cherry preserves, kirsch, and raspberry are the primary notes both aromatically and on the palate. It is super-expressive and mouth-filling with a very long finish. “High density vineyards and low yields are the secret to Grenache,” says Baron.""","""Dense flavors of deep cherry fruit hold center stage in this intense and concentrated 100% Grenache.

Saxum James Berry Vineyard 2009,$239.00,"
","""Simply put, the 2009 James Berry Vineyard is one of the greatest young wines I have ever tasted from California, or anywhere for that matter. Bright, floral aromatics lead to expressive red fruit in this impossibly elegant, dazzling wine. A melange of rose petals, mint and licorice follows as the James Berry shows off its breathtaking clarity and finesse. Fine-grained, chalky tannins frame the exceptional finish. Frankly, I am surprised this is the first wine of the tasting. Where does one go from here? The 2009 James Berry is a bit of departure from previous vintages. This is the highest percentage of Grenache ever used in the blend, and a large portion of the Grenache was aged in concrete, an approach Smith has borrowed from producers in the Rhone. Originally Smith had intended to age less of the Grenache components in concrete, but the low yields of the vintage forced him to age about two-thirds of the Grenache in concrete. Call it a happy coincidence, but it certainly looks like things turned out well. Readers should do whatever they can to taste this fabulous wine. In 2009 the James Berry Vineyard is 57% Grenache, 31% Mourvedre and 12% Syrah. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2021.""","""Strikingly complex, rich and fruity, this beautifully proportioned red delivers an initial burst of red berry fruit that echoes red and black licorice.

The Clos is another wine that saturates the palate with endless layers of aromas and flavors in a style that is all about persistence and length.

""","""As it was from cask last year this remains quite closed but aggressive swirling liberates ripe aromas of sea breeze, pear, lemon rind, oyster shell and mineral reduction plus an abundance of typical floral scents. The large-scaled flavors are overtly powerful and impressively concentrated as there is plenty of palate staining dry extract that also buffers the very firm acidity that supports and shapes the gorgeously precise finish. This explosively long effort possesses exquisite balance and the tightly wound flavors are going to need at least 5 to 7 years of bottle age to really flesh out and blossom. This is also a knock-out.""","""Good pale, green-tinged yellow.  Reticent aromas of lemon oil, white pepper and powdered stone.  Minerally and powerful, conveying a strong impression of dry extract.

Gorgeously balanced and constructed, this has sensual texture and controlled tannins to go with the typical Touriga aromatics. It seems light on its feet, but there is actually quite notable mid-palate concentration here. It is a very fine performance from Vallado, which has become one of the more interesting monovarietal Touriga producers. At the moment, I'm thinking this is their best vintage yet, as unevolved as it is. I won-t be surprised if it merits a slight uptick one day.

Freshly cut flowers, white peaches and pears are woven together in a Champagne that impresses for its focus and energy. Chiseled saline note support the crystalline finish. I imagine the 2004 will always remain relatively bright and linear, but at the same time, each time I have tasted it over the last two years the 2004 seems to have a little more body and broader shoulders. The 2004 will appeal most to readers who find the 2002 and 2003 too exuberant.

Deep purple, with loads of bouquet garni, beef blood, blackberry, kirsch, smoke and truffle, this wine is full-bodied, rich and showing even better than it did last year.

Delamotte Blanc de Blancs 2002,$79.99,"Its complexity is the result of this care and time.

The mouthwatering flavors extend for minutes, providing a glimpse of what this may become with another ten years in bottle.

""","""Since around two-thirds of Delamotte production represents their basic Brut; another 25% their non-vintage Blanc de Blancs; and there is a bit of rose, too, it follows that their 2002 Brut Blanc de Blancs represents a rare bird indeed; and from its being on the market now (in the form of a late-2012 disgorgement) you can recognize how little hurry the house is to release their vintage bottling. Already in the nose, hints of walnut and pistachio oils point toward the bittersweet, subtly smoky, faintly toasty aspect of a bottling that at the same time harbors pure and succulent apple and pear wreathed in heliotrope and orange blossom inner-mouth perfume. A vividly scallop-like and salivary gland-milking sweet- saline, mineral-animal savor opens the floodgates of the salivary glands, and for some of us, perhaps even the tear ducts. This finishes with extraordinary persistence and alliance of richness with levity. Especially considering that, in a vintage of this quality, Salon was not giving up their fruit to help inform this vintage Delamotte, it represents an outstanding accomplishment; and what's more, a quite stunning value for its genre.

Rich, textured and utterly impeccable, the 2002 impresses for its breadth and creaminess. This is a fairly accessible 2002 with plenty of near and medium-term appeal. The long, pointed finish is especially of note.""","""A relatively high-toned nose of green apple, baker's yeast, floral and citrus peel hints precedes the distinctly effervescent, even slightly foamy flavors that possess good depth on the bone dry finish. This is clearly still on its way up as the focused finish is still compact and while this is certainly refreshing and there is enough depth present to make for an interesting drink, it will be better in due course. In sum, there is good development potential and will especially please those who prefer very dry vintage Champagne."""

The blend was aged in French barriques (70% new) for 17 months. Crisp and elegant, this has a beautifully balanced feel to it. There is nothing obvious or sexy here. It simply becomes more expressive and interesting with aeration (4+ hours), at which time it proves that there are promises here that will be kept.
